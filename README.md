This Data Structures project was done with mimimal amounts of collaboration with peer, Jonah Rubin and accomplishes the following objectives:

- Developed a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, implementing three distinct game modes: Classic, Donut (toroidal grid), and Mirror.
- Designed dynamic grid systems to compute cell generations based on neighbor interactions and game-specific rules.
- Utilized object-oriented principles, including inheritance and class hierarchies, to extend and optimize game functionalities across modes.

There are no instructions for running assignment, just compile and run and the program will tell you what to do.
